This package contains MATLAB code used to generate metrics described in:
Roos and May, 2012. Classification of unit types in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus of laboratory mice. Hearing Research 289, 13-16.

The packages contains:
1. Functions for computing unit metrics and classifying unit types.
2. A demonstration script.
3. Spiking data for several units, used by the demo script.

Metrics are computed only for PSTH data (spike trains stimulated by repeated presentations of BF tones). Metrics related to rate-level functions and frequency response maps are not included.
